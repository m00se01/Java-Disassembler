# Java-Disassembler 
Spring 2020

Takes a binary file and returns the arm assembly instructions. Limited to very basic assembly instructions

A Quick note for the ./run.sh script

After the ./run.sh $<dir/fileName.machine>

You'll be prompted to enter the the filepath for the machine file again
So please just enter the same <dir/fileName.machine> path that you used
previously.

If you don't enter a $<dir/fileName.machine> as a parameter when you
run the ./run.sh script and then enter a <dir/fileName.machine> for the prompt
it will return an error and vice versa.

Also the build.sh and run.sh scripts are found inside the src\dissasembler\ folder
